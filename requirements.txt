# This app uses only standard Python libraries:
# - tkinter (for GUI)
# - re (for regex)
# - urllib (for URL parsing)
# - os (for file handling)

# No external pip-installable dependencies required.
# If tkinter is not available (uncommon), it's part of Python's standard library; install via your OS (e.g., apt install python3-tk).
